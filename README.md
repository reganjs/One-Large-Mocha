# One-Large-Mocha

## A repository used to further understand unit testing using Mocha &amp; Chai. 

To further understand unit testing I had to solve a problem. A shouldBuyCar.js and carTest file was implemented which solves the following below.

This repo will test whether the following is true or false:

  - should return true when the car is pink
  - should return false when there are no details about the car
  - should return false when the car is a hatchback
  - should return false when the car is a hatchback and pink
  - should return true when the car has 6 litres/100km and is under or equal to $5,000
  - should return true when the car has 11 litres/100km and is under or equal to $5,000
  - should return false when the car has 6 litres/100km and is over $5,000
  - should return false when the car has 11 litres/100km and is over $5,000
  - should return false when the car has 5 litres/100km and is under or equal to $5,000
  - should return false when the car has 12 litres/100km and is under or equal to $5,000
  - should return undefined when there is no car
